* SMC convergence analysis

  The files in this directory run various numerical experiments
  (convergence, speed etc) for SMC.

** Multirate speed tests

   This test uses the FlameInABox binary to compare vanilla SDC
   execution times to MRSDC execution times.

   First, sync local sources to the remote host and build the
   FlameInABox executable:

   $ fab -H hopper build:flamebox

   Next, run the speed tests, compare the results, and plot the results:

   $ fab -H hopper flamebox_speed
   $ fab -H hopper flamebox_speed_compare
   $ fab -H hopper flamebox_speed_plot

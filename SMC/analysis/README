* SMC convergence analysis

  The files in this directory run various numerical experiments
  (convergence, speed etc) for SMC.

** Multirate speed tests

   This test uses the FlameInABox binary to compare vanilla SDC
   execution times to MRSDC execution times.

   First, sync local sources to the remote host and build the
   FlameInABox executable:

   $ fab -H hopper build:flamebox

   Note that the preferred setup on Hopper is: OMP3 branch of BoxLib,
   intel/13.1.2.183 compiler.

   Next, run the speed tests, compare the results, and plot the results:

   $ fab -H hopper flamebox_speed
   $ fab -H hopper flamebox_speed_compare
   $ fab -H hopper flamebox_speed_plot

** Multirate convergence tests

   This test uses the FlameBall binary to verify that MRSDC works to
   spec.

   First, sync local sources to the remote host and build the
   FlameBall executable:

   $ fab -H hopper build:flameball,opts='CONVERGENCE\=t'

   Next, run the convergence tests and compare the results:

   $ fab -H hopper flameball_mrconv
   $ fab -H hopper flameball_mrconv_compare
   $ fab -H hopper flameball_mrconv_tabulate

** Scaling tests

   This test uses the FlameBall binary to do a strong scaling test.

   $ fab -H hopper flameball_scaling
   $ fab -H hopper flameball_scaling_plot

To use Fuego to generate c code for the mechanisms

1) Source the appropriate setup.sh having set CCSE_DIR to point to the folder containing the 
     BoxLib and Combustion git repos (check variables set in that script to ensure your 
     install is consistent with the assumptions there)
2) Build the "convert.exe" executable under CCSE_DIR/Combustion/Chemistry/Tools/convert
3) Run the make script in the appropriate mechanism directory (i.e. cd chem-H; sh make-chem-H.sh)

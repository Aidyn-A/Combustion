# $Log: f77.def,v $
# Revision 1.11  2003/04/18 21:53:36  cummings
# Updated each of the current f77.def files to add an explicit definition
# for COMPILER_F90_NAME, the name of the F90 compiler.  Some systems allow
# you to use F90 for either F90 or F77 code, while others have separate tools.
# Because of this, you must set F77 to $(COMPILER_F90_NAME) in your local.def
# file if you need the F90 compiler.
#
# Revision 1.10  2001/07/18 03:42:18  cummings
# Changed PGI compiler optimization flag from -O2 to -fast.  This is like
# -O2 but also adds -Mnoframe, -Munroll and some Pentium-specific stuff.
# Also added flag --no_using_std to C++ compiles, which turns off the
# implicit "using namespace std;" statement that pgCC normally includes
# by default.
#
# Revision 1.9  2000/10/11 19:12:37  cummings
# Added flag for code instrumentation and profiling with pgprof.
#
# Revision 1.8  2000/10/03 01:38:12  cummings
# Removed -Msecond_underscore flag, since the normal symbol translation
# stuff can handle this.  Added mixed language support.
#
# Revision 1.7  2000/09/21 21:24:50  cummings
# Changed compiler to pgf90, since we need the F90 compiler for our code.
# Changed compile-time SOFLAG to -fpic and added link-time SOFLAG with
# value of -shared.
#
# Revision 1.6  2000/05/19 23:07:06  aivazis
# Changed the way module paths are generated
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/05/17 23:37:26  aivazis
# Major update in the way defines and include paths are handled
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/04/06 23:03:21  aivazis
# Added module path flag name
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/04/06 22:55:21  aivazis
# Stubbed out dependency generation, for now
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/09/16 20:34:14  aivazis
# Added generation of an extra trailing underscore on FORTRAN externals for
# g77 compatibility. Added PGI library path to the command line

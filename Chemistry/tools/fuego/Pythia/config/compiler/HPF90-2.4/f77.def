# $Log: f77.def,v $
# Revision 1.10  2003/04/18 21:53:35  cummings
# Updated each of the current f77.def files to add an explicit definition
# for COMPILER_F90_NAME, the name of the F90 compiler.  Some systems allow
# you to use F90 for either F90 or F77 code, while others have separate tools.
# Because of this, you must set F77 to $(COMPILER_F90_NAME) in your local.def
# file if you need the F90 compiler.
#
# Revision 1.9  2002/01/29 22:44:34  cummings
# Modified definition of COMPILER_LF90_LIBRARIES to use new shared version
# of the F90 standard library, which is now installed on tis-sa-ack in the
# standard /usr/lib locations rather than in /opt/fortran90/lib.  This new
# shared library requires the addition of -lcps and -lpthread to handle
# the use of data with thread local storage (TLS).
#
# Revision 1.8  2001/09/28 01:29:33  cummings
# Undo previous change, restoring -lcl to list of F90 libraries to link
# against when using the C/C++ compiler to link.  I thought that removing
# this was going to solve a problem with dynamic loading of shared libraries
# that contain F90 code on the HP platform, but it does not help.  <Sigh>
#
# Revision 1.7  2001/09/27 21:00:19  cummings
# Removed -lcl from list of F90 libraries needed on HP platforms.
# This one is apparently no longer needed in HPUX 11.x, and it
# causes problems when building shared libraries because it
# contains thread-specific data.  Such libraries cannot be
# dynamically loaded with dlopen().
#
# Revision 1.6  2001/01/30 01:44:44  cummings
# Replaced hard-wired 64-bit compile option and library path
# with flags set by choosing either 32bit or 64bit target.
# Added "+ppu" compile option to force a trailing underscore
# on Fortran symbols in either 32-bit or 64-bit compiles.
# Added definition of flag for sending output modules to a
# directory, rather than just putting them in the current
# directory, so that we can separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/09/19 06:31:34  aivazis
# Added COMPILER_LCXX_FLAGS
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/09/19 04:12:07  aivazis
# Fixed the modules flag
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/09/15 01:12:04  cummings
# Changed opt flag to +O2, just to be consistent with other HP
# compiler settings for optimization.  Changed Fortran libpath
# and libraries to pick up the PA2.0 64-bit libraries.  You
# need to have the environment variable HPF90_DIR set to the root
# directory of the F90 compiler, which is /opt/fortran90 on "skinner".
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/09/14 23:09:27  cummings
# Changed compiler flags to produce 64-bit ELF (same setting as
# in HPaCC file).  Corrected flag for producing position-independent
# code.  Added flags for profiling with gprof and for producing a
# shared object rather than an executable using the Fortran compiler.

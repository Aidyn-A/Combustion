# $Log: f77.def,v $
# Revision 1.12  2003/04/18 21:53:35  cummings
# Updated each of the current f77.def files to add an explicit definition
# for COMPILER_F90_NAME, the name of the F90 compiler.  Some systems allow
# you to use F90 for either F90 or F77 code, while others have separate tools.
# Because of this, you must set F77 to $(COMPILER_F90_NAME) in your local.def
# file if you need the F90 compiler.
#
# Revision 1.11  2002/02/11 20:10:17  cummings
# Added the flag -qfixed=132 to allow Fortran source code line widths of
# up to 132 characters.  This is necessary when using Tau auto-instrumentation
# because some of the inserted macros can be several characters long.
#
# Revision 1.10  2002/01/11 05:08:02  cummings
# Adjusted the Fortran optimization flags slightly to eliminate
# some problems with the code failing to run properly on the IBM
# SP2 at SDSC.  Through process of elimination, I figured out
# which flags were causing the problem.  Also added -qmaxmem flag
# to increase the size of subroutine that can be optimized, to
# eliminate warnings from the compiler about some routines not
# being optimized.
#
# Revision 1.9  2001/01/31 22:04:03  cummings
# Added -bmaxdata and -bmaxstack flags to IBM compiler link line so that we have the maximum possible amount of memory per node available for allocating large arrays.
#
# Revision 1.8  2001/01/31 18:34:06  cummings
# Changed optimization flag from -O4 to -O3, since interprocedural analysis is causing internal compiler errors when building VTF.  Removed -qfloat flags and added recommended -qhot flag.
#
# Revision 1.7  2001/01/30 22:48:26  cummings
# Added format flag to archive command to specify 32-bit or 64-bit archive format.\n
#
# Revision 1.6  2001/01/30 21:33:17  cummings
# Added 32-bit and 64-bit compile options for IBM compiler.
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/09/27 00:26:20  cummings
# Changed name of compiler binary from mpxlf to xlf,
# since we handle MPI linkage explicitly.  Simplified
# flags for optimization by using -O4, which automatically
# provides most of the flags we were specifying already,
# such as -qhot, -qipa, and -qtune=auto.  Added appropriate
# flags for profiling code and for module file search
# directories.  Added mixed language support when linking
# with the C or C++ compiler.  Added *.mod files to the
# list of files to be cleaned up with "mm clean".
#
# Revision 1.4  2000/05/19 22:22:05  sharon
# fixed IBM preprocessor flags for proper handling of defines
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/05/17 23:37:26  aivazis
# Major update in the way defines and include paths are handled
#
# Revision 1.2  2000/05/16 22:34:52  sharon
# fixed IBM compilation flags. Now they apply to both the 604's and power3's
#
# Revision 1.1  2000/05/03 16:33:21  sharon
# add f77.def to repository

# Revision 1.7  2003/06/04 02:00:09  cummings
# Upgrade our default PYTHON_VERSION setting to 2.2.  This can be overridden in the user's environment or cummings.def file, but we are now making extensive use of Python 2.2 features in Pyre.
#
# Revision 1.6  2001/08/18 03:21:28  cummings
# Added "config" after $(PYTHON_LIBDIR) in absolute pathname for Python
# static library archive.  Most people set $(PYTHON_LIBDIR) to be
# $(PYTHON_DIR)/lib/python$(PYTHON_VERSION), where $(PYTHON_VERSION)
# is currently 2.1.  It turns out that the Python install Makefile target
# actually installs the library in a subdirectory of this directory called
# "config".  This change may mess people up if their PYTHON_DIR environment
# variables are pointing to an installation that has been set up manually.
# But I think it makes more sense to configure things such that if you
# check out, build and install Python-2.1 yourself, everything is correct.
#
# Revision 1.5  2001/08/02 22:09:51  cummings
# Changed location for Python library from TOOLS_DIR to PYTHON_LIBDIR, since Python may be built locally and not installed in TOOLS_DIR.
#
# Revision 1.4  2001/04/21 19:59:08  aivazis
# Added support for embedding python
#
# Revision 1.3  2000/05/17 23:37:26  aivazis
# Major update in the way defines and include paths are handled
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/06/09 01:38:48  mga
# Fixed typos and added header

# Read the local settigs

# Revision 1.12  2002/09/04 21:51:32  cummings
# Set BLITZ_LIBDIR to be format-specific for 32-bit or 64-bit if building
# on Irix platform.
#
# Revision 1.11  2002/07/18 01:24:17  cummings
# Set BLITZ_DIR to $TOOLS_DIR/Blitz++ and BLITZ_INCDIR to $BLITZ_DIR/include.
# There is now an official installed version of the Blitz package on asap in
# /home/tools/Blitz++, and this is what we should begin using from now on.
# The official Blitz cvs repository at oonumerics.org is now being updated
# regularly, so we can use this version to build and install Blitz as needed.
# We will soon phase out the use of our private copy of the Blitz sources
# in /VTF/tools/blitz, as it is no longer current.
#
# Revision 1.10  2002/05/15 18:27:02  cummings
# I managed to convince Michael that we should undo the previous change
# and set BLITZ_INCDIR to BLITZ_DIR rather than BLITZ_DIR/include.  This
# default setting matches what blitz does by default when you build it,
# which is to leave the blitz headers under the blitz installation directory.
# If you checkout blitz in BLD_ROOT/tools/blitz and build it, the default
# settings will work for you, and you do not need to set any environment
# variables.  If you decide to build blitz somewhere else or move the
# include or library files after the build, you can set the environment
# variables BLITZ_DIR, BLITZ_INCDIR or BLITZ_LIBDIR accordingly.
#
# Revision 1.9  2002/05/15 03:39:13  aivazis
# Reset the default INCDIR
#
# Revision 1.8  2002/05/15 02:48:29  cirak
# changed the default INC directory to $(BLITZ_DIR)
#
# Revision 1.7  2002/05/14 20:23:39  aivazis
# Added derivations of the LIB and INC directories
#
# Revision 1.6  2002/05/14 20:21:20  aivazis
# Fixed a typo
#
# Revision 1.5  2002/05/14 20:15:21  aivazis
# Added blitz to the include path
#
# Revision 1.4  2002/05/13 16:10:32  cummings
# Add -DBZ_TAU_PROFILING to BLITZ_FLAGS if we are using the tau build
# target.  This will enable Tau macros within Blitz code.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/07/11 23:32:20  cummings
# Removed the --strict-warnings flag from the list of BLITZ_FLAGS
# when compiling with KCC.  This flag is not needed to make Blitz
# compile properly and generates a lot of annoying warnings about
# the use of the non-standard long long type in the C standard
# header files.  We don't need to see this stuff.
#
# Revision 1.2  2001/07/07 02:15:11  cummings
# Updated this definitions file for the Blitz package.
# Removed the inclusion of a platform-specific Blitz
# definitions file, since there does not seem to be
# any use for this at the moment.  Instead, we define
# BLITZ_FLAGS to contain any C++ compiler flags needed
# by Blitz and define BLITZ_DIR to point to the Blitz
# installation, which is in $(BLD_ROOT)/tools/blitz.
# We also add the Blitz library to EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES.

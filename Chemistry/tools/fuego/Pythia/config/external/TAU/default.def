# Revision 1.6  2002/01/24 00:57:52  cummings
# Removed redefinition of CXX and CC macros to use Tau versions
# of these macros.  This is not good since Tau adds some compile
# flags that we may not want to use in our compiles.
#
# Revision 1.5  2001/12/26 23:53:22  cummings
# Fixed library ordering to link with special Tau MPI libraries first if
# building with mpi target, followed by Tau library itself.  Also, use
# Tau shared library instead of ordinary archive file (this fixes a
# problem under Irix).  Removed the use of TAU_MPI_INCLUDE macro, since
# the MPI include file search path is already handled by our build
# procedure in the MPI definitions file.
#
# Revision 1.4  2001/12/10 22:07:09  cummings
# Removed Tau include and define flags from TARGET_F77_FLAGS because
# no Tau headers are included in Fortran instrumented source code.
# These -I and -D flags are only relevant for C/C++ code.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/11/30 02:54:36  cummings
# Removed Tau library flags from TARGET_LCXX_FLAGS, TARGET_LCC_FLAGS,
# and TARGET_LF77_FLAGS.  Just listing them in EXTERNAL_LIBS is enough
# to get them included at the end of the link command line.  Also,
# added any local Tau-instrumented C++ source files to the list of files
# to be removed by the "clean" target, so that we can remove these files
# after they are no longer needed.
#
# Revision 1.2  2001/11/28 23:25:38  cummings
# Added the Tau library flags to the list of EXTERNAL_LIBS so that they get
# included at the end of the LIBRARIES list along with things like the MPI
# libraries when linking executables.
#
# Revision 1.1  2001/11/10 02:03:18  cummings
